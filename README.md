I am lids, coding enthusiast!<br>
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a flask (restful) application related to travels, just because we can't travel for real!<br> 
ğŸŒ± I code in python, however as versitile as this language is, I am now learning web side of it.<br> 
ğŸŒ± I'm pretty new to front-end development too. So far, feeling somewhat comortable with JS and HTML. But I know this is just a start!<br>
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any cool project, preferably involving python, web and machine learning.<br>
